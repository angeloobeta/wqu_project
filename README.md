**Project Description**

In this project I used natural language processing to train various machine learning models to predict an 
Amazon review rating based on the text of the review. Further, I used one of the trained models to gain 
insight on the reviews, identifying words that are highly polar. With these highly polar words identified, 
one can understand what words highly influence the modelâ€™s prediction.
